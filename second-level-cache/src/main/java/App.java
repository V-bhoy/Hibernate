// SECOND LEVEL CACHE
// it is a caching mechanism that stores objects across sessions,
// unlike the first-level cache which is session-specific.
// The goal of second-level cache is to reduce database access by storing entity data,
// collections, and queries in a shared cache (across multiple sessions/factory).
// It is optional and needs to be explicitly configured. It is disabled by default
//It is SessionFactory-level, meaning all sessions created by the factory can use the cache.
// It caches data after the first session loads it from the DB, making future retrievals faster
// without hitting the DB again.
// To enable second level cache -
// add dependencies for hibernate-jcache and cache provider like Ehcache, Infinispan, Hazelcast, or OSCache.
// we used ehcache in the demo and the version of jcache should be same as hibernate core
// add hibernate configuration properties
// hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache=true
// hibernate.cache.region.factory_class=org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory
// hibernate.cache.use_query_cache=true
// the use second level cache property is optional as it is set to true by default
// as soon as the region factory class for the cache is set on adding the dependencies
// to cache hql queries or criteria api , you need to set use query cache property to true
// for caching the entities at second level, you need to use annotation @Cacheable,
// which is inherited by child classes as well
// set the CacheConcurrencyStrategy by using @Cache annotation with attribute usage
// it is an annotation-level configuration in Hibernate used to define
// how the second-level cache should manage concurrent access to cached entities
// â€” basically how it handles consistency, transactions, and updates.
// ðŸ”¸ Why Do We Need It?
//  When multiple users/sessions read and write the same cached entity:
//	â€¢	How do you keep the cache consistent with the database?
//	â€¢	What should happen if one session updates the DB but another reads stale data from the cache?
//Thatâ€™s where CacheConcurrencyStrategy comes into play.
// There are four strategies -
// READ_ONLY - No updates allowed. Fastest, safest for immutable data
// If you try to modify the entity and commit the transaction â†’ Hibernate will throw an exception.
// No updates allowed, neither in the database nor in the cache.
// NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE - Updates allowed but no strict guarantee of consistency. May serve stale data temporarily.
// READ_WRITE - Uses versioning to keep cache consistent with DB. Slower but ensures data integrity.
// TRANSACTIONAL - Full ACID-compliant transactions using JTA. Needs a fully transactional cache provider.
// If your entity is never modified after creation â†’ go with READ_ONLY.
// If itâ€™s read often and modified rarely â†’ NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE is a good balance.
// For frequent reads and writes, prefer READ_WRITE.
// Good for -
// Frequently read, rarely updated data (e.g., product catalog, user profiles).
// Data shared across sessions.
// Read-heavy applications.
// Avoid if:
// Data changes often and consistency is critical.
//	You donâ€™t want the complexity of cache invalidation.

// PROCESS
//  First: Hibernate checks first-level cache.
//	If not found â†’ it checks second-level cache.
//	If still not found â†’ it hits the DB, and caches the entity in both first-level and second-level caches.
// when update happens , hibernate marks the cached entity dirty in first level
// updates the db, replaces the cached entity in second level with new entity on incrementing the entity version
// the session cache is cleared upon session.close() or clear()
